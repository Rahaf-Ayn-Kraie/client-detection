# Client-detection Application

## Overview
This is a **Client Detection Application** that retrieves and displays essential system information such as the operating system name, browser name, system language, window dimensions, battery status, and network status. The app dynamically updates its content based on changes in window size, network status, and battery status.

## Features

- **System Information**: Detects and displays the operating system name, browser name, and system language.
- **Window Information**: Displays and dynamically updates the window width, height, and orientation.
- **Battery Information**: Retrieves battery level and charging status, with support for browsers that do not expose this information.
- **Network Status**: Displays whether the user is online or offline, with dynamic updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the layout and content based on the window size.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML** : This language is used to give structure to the page and to give the content for the user to read.
- **CSS** : This is used to add style to the website and to make it elegant and interesting. So, that it can grab the attention of the user.
- **JS** : To make the page interactive, we use JavaScript. It helps the user to easily interact and gain knowledge from different sources at a time by just clicking the link. 
- **BOM** : The **Browser Object Model (BOM)** refers to the interaction between JavaScript and the web browser. BOM allows JavaScript to interact with the browser window and perform tasks such as:

- Manipulating the browser window (resize, move, or close the window).
- Accessing information about the browser (name, version, and platform).
- Managing browser history (navigate between pages, reload or go back/forward).
- Controlling browser behavior (open/close pop-ups, or setting timeouts).
- Detecting and responding to changes in the network status, battery level, and other system information.
